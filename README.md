## User Stories

As a busy person, I want to:
- [ ] Add tasks to a list so that I can keep track of them
- [ ] Check things off my list so that I can see what I’ve done
- [ ] Delete things from the list if I don’t need to do them anymore
- [ ] Use all the features of the app without a mouse
- [ ] Filter out completed to-dos from my list so that I can focus on what’s left to do

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] A working to-do list
- [ ] Tests for (at least) each user story
- [ ] A responsive, mobile-first design
- [ ] Ensure your app is accessible to as many different users as possible
